Project Name
Real-Time Change Data Capture for Postgres Using Debezium and Kafka
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract of Project

This project implements a Change Data Capture (CDC) architecture to track changes in a 
Postgres database in real-time. The architecture leverages Docker, Debezium, Kafka, and
Apache Zookeeper to capture, stream, and manage data changes efficiently. By capturing database 
changes as they occur, organizations can ensure that their data pipelines and downstream systems
are always up-to-date, enabling more responsive and accurate data processing and analytics.
