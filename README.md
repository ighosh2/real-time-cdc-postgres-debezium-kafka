Real-Time Change Data Capture for Postgres Using Debezium and Kafka

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Abstract of Project**

This project implements a Change Data Capture (CDC) architecture to track changes in a 
Postgres database in real-time. The architecture leverages Docker, Debezium, Kafka, and
Apache Zookeeper to capture, stream, and manage data changes efficiently. By capturing database 
changes as they occur, organizations can ensure that their data pipelines and downstream systems
are always up-to-date, enabling more responsive and accurate data processing and analytics.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**What Are We Trying to Solve**

In many organizations, maintaining up-to-date data across multiple systems is crucial but 
challenging. Traditional batch processing methods can lead to delays, inconsistencies, and
outdated data in downstream applications. This project aims to solve these issues by implementing
a real-time data capture and streaming architecture. The goal is to minimize latency, reduce
the risk of data inconsistencies, and provide a reliable way to propagate database changes 
instantly to other systems.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Use Case Which Can Benefit on Implementation in Organizations**

Organizations across various industries can benefit from implementing this CDC architecture,
particularly those requiring real-time data synchronization, such as:

**E-commerce Platforms:** Keeping inventory levels and product information up-to-date across multiple
sales channels.

**Financial Institutions:** Ensuring real-time updates of transaction data for fraud detection, 
risk management, and reporting.

**Healthcare Providers:** Synchronizing patient records and treatment data across different systems
to provide accurate and timely care.

**Logistics and Supply Chain Management:** Maintaining real-time visibility of shipment status
and inventory levels across various locations.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Libraries Used:**

faker: Used to generate fake data such as user profiles, cities, countries, etc.

psycopg2: A PostgreSQL adapter for Python to interact with the Postgres database.

datetime: For handling timestamp data.

random: To generate random values for transaction attributes.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Technology Used and Why**

**Docker:**

Why: Containerization ensures each component of the CDC architecture runs in an isolated 
environment, improving manageability, scalability, and deployment consistency.

Usage: Containerizes all components, including Postgres, Debezium, Kafka, and Zookeeper,
allowing them to run independently and cohesively.

**Postgres (PostgreSQL):**

Why: A reliable, robust, and feature-rich relational database management system widely 
used in various applications.

Usage: Serves as the primary database where client transactions are stored and changes are monitored.

**Debezium:**

Why: Provides a comprehensive and reliable solution for capturing database changes in real-time,
supporting various databases, including Postgres.

Usage: Monitors the Postgres database for any changes (inserts, updates, deletes) and streams 
these changes to Kafka.

**Kafka (Apache Kafka):**

Why: A highly scalable and fault-tolerant distributed streaming platform ideal for handling high
volumes of data streams.

Usage: Acts as the central messaging system that receives changes captured by Debezium and distributes
them to various consumers.

**Apache Zookeeper:**

Why: Essential for managing and coordinating Kafka brokers, ensuring smooth operation and 
configuration management of the Kafka cluster.

Usage: Manages Kafka broker configurations, synchronization, and and naming services.

**Future Scope of Work:**

As a potential future scope , an integration of the a reporting tool like Tableau/Power BI will
be done , where we can track in realtime the changes in the database as well as past changes
in terms of graphical charts. This will end the end client/stakeholder to have an understanding
of the system without delving deep into the tech side. Hence can take logical decisions 
based on the graphical view / mapping of the system in place


Integrating Tableau with the project can provide significant benefits for clients and stakeholders
by transforming raw data into actionable insights through interactive dashboards and visualizations. 
Hereâ€™s how Tableau can be leveraged:

Interactive Dashboards:

Create dynamic and interactive dashboards that allow clients to explore the changes in the Postgres
database in real-time. Users can drill down into specific details and filter data based on various
parameters such as time range, type of change (insert, update, delete), and affected tables.
Real-time Data Visualization:

Connect Tableau directly to the Kafka topics or the downstream systems updated by the CDC pipeline
to visualize real-time data changes. This enables stakeholders to monitor live updates and trends as 
database changes are captured and processed.
Change Trends Analysis:

Visualize trends in database changes over time to identify patterns and insights. This can help 
businesses understand the frequency and impact of changes in their data, aiding in performance tuning
and optimization.

Performance Metrics:

Track key performance metrics such as the volume of changes captured, latency of data propagation, 
and the performance of the CDC pipeline. This can provide insights into the efficiency of the data
capture and streaming architecture.

Customizable Reports:

Generate customizable reports that can be shared with different departments within the organization.
These reports can include insights tailored to the specific needs of IT operations, business intelligence,
and other teams.

Alerting and Notifications:

Set up alerts and notifications within Tableau to inform stakeholders about significant changes or
anomalies in the data. This ensures that key decision-makers are always aware of critical insights as
they happen.

Data Synchronization Monitoring:

Use Tableau to monitor the synchronization status of data across various systems. This helps ensure
data consistency and reliability, providing a clear view of the state of data across the organization.
